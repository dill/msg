\usage{
\method{Predict.matrix}{msg.smooth}(object, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a smooth specification object, usually generated by a term
\code{s(...,bs="ds",...)}. Note that \code{xt} object is needed, see
Details.}

\item{data}{a list containing just the data (including any \code{by}
variable) required by this term, with names corresponding to
\code{object$term} (and \code{object$by}). The \code{by} variable is the
last element.}
}
\description{
Provides smoothing methods for multidimensional scaling-based projections
of the data.
}
\details{
Usage is split into two cases: (1) For geographical smooths of two
coordinates, within-area distances with respect to the boundary are used to
create a distance matrix that is then projected into as many dimensions as
required. (2) General distance smoothing where distances are calculated
between observations based on all covariates supplied using Euclidean or
Mahalanobis distances.

In both cases smoothing is performed using Duchon splines (see
\code{\link{Duchon.spline}} for more information).
